Pai-Wei,

attached is a file with the input tensors you need + all the metadata. This is for water molecule with cc-pVDZ basis.
Here's a short primer:

nirreps: number of symmetry blocks (of occupied and virtual indices)
nmo: total number of indices = O + V
nocc_act_alpha: O for alpha spin
nocc_act_beta: O for beta spin
nvir_act_alpha: V for alpha spin
nvir_act_beta: V for beta spin
obs_mosym_alpha: symmetry block of each alpha spin index; these values can be [0,nirreps-1];
        occupied come first (e,g, the occupied orbitals have symmetries 0, 0, 3, 0, 2)
obs_mosym_beta: symmetry block of each beta spin index

next come nonzero elements of f tensor. In this case it is diagonal, but you cannot assume that it is
in general CC method. I did not split it up into blocks (oo, ov, vv, etc.), but that's straightforward: indices
of the given tensor are combined o+v indices, i.e. 0 is the first O index, 1 is the second O index, â€¦ 4 is the 5th
O index, 5 is the first V index, etc. These indices were described by obs_mosym_alpha and obs_mosym_beta.
Also, in this case f tensor is the same for alpha and beta spin, but you cannot use this fact and should treat them
separately (if you consider a different molecule alpha and beta spins will no longer be equivalent).

next are nonzero elements of v tensor. Again, it's given in combined o+v form.

**WARNING: v tensor is given in so-called chemists notation, whereas all equations you have use v tensor in physicist's notation. When you read v tensor just
swap second and third indices, that will convert to physicists notation. Henceforth in this document I use physicists notation.**

There is an additional complication regarding spin.
What is given is alpha-beta v tensor (v_ab), but you can compute v_aa from it (in this case v_aa and v_bb are the same, but you cannot
use this fact -- you must treat them separately):

v_aa [p1][p2][p3][p4] = v_ab[p1][p2][p3][p4] - v_ab[p1][p2][p4][p3]

Note that v_aa is therefore antisymmetric with respect to permutation of indices p3 and p4. It is also antisymmetric with
respect to permutation of indices p1 and p2 because v_ab has what you guys called "vertex" symmetry:

v_ab[p1][p2][p3][p4] = v_ab[p2][p1][p4][p3]

------------------

Lastly, about how to do CC iterations. It's very simple. Set initial t amplitudes to zero. Changes in t1 and t2 amplitudes are obtained
by scaling the residuals of the CC amplitude equations as follows:

delta_t1_a[o1][v1] = r1_a[o1][v1] / ( f_a_o[o1][o1] - f_a_v[v1][v1] )
t1_a += delta_t1_a;
same for beta spin

delta_t2_ab[o1][o2][v1][v2] = r2_ab[o1][o2][v1][v2] / ( f_a_o[o1][o1] + f_b_o[o2][o2] - f_a_v[v1][v1] - f_b_v[v2][v2] )
t2_ab += delta_t2_ab;

same for aa and ab

The interpretation is that residuals are like gradients of t amplitudes and the differences of diagonal f tensor elements are
like approximate hessian for t amplitudes. So this is an inexact Newton update.

Do this until norms of the residuals fall below a certain small threshold, like 10^-10. You should also compute the CC energy
after each iteration to monitor progress.

To help troubleshooting: the first iteration residual r1 should be zero and r2 should equal corresponding v tensor.
Hence after the first iteration t1 will still be zero but t2 will not be.

Good luck!
